What is next?

Not any goals. :)

For me, next is to build a system, that would continously help me build paths to whatever aims I establish throughout my career and personal life. I am aiming for taking pride in the identities that I choose to take, but very carefully, and being very open to change when I find myself in the wrong.

The system will keep on evolving but what I am aiming for the system as of today is to achieve is to help me to build continous habits that help me make progress by 1% everyday, which would eventually compound to larger and more visible gains. The system is like a voting system, there will be some negative votes, some NOTA, but the goal for the success in the system is to achieve "most" positive votes to claim wins throughout the time.

The system is simple right now, I am becoming the person (look, the idea of "becoming the person" is to pick identity) that decides a small set of tasks everday, tries to do them everyday and then collect compound returns from them over a long time :)

I'll keep the system very simple for a few weeks, and evolve it as it demands to :)

One important thing to always remember is that there is always room for improvment, you can always be better and there is never a time to not be humble.
