It is important to not abandon a working system if you were getting results out of it. Mind goes to wonder how you got some results out in school, and it is not very surprising to note that the motivation was probably driven drastically by a goal in mind, let it be either good grades or satisfaction of making your parents and people around you happy.

However, this system is rigged if there are no concrete goals or you don't anymore want to work just for making others happy. It's hard to make the shift when you've to decide goals yourself or make the shift to do things to make yourself (and eventually people around you) to be happy. It's good to take steps to make this shift, do them everyday for defining a better system and to ultimately achieve your concretely defined goals.
