I belive some tasks that I've taken as my goals require me to work on them "every" day. Breaking continuity has broken my thought process, diminished any improvments that I made in the past, and has contributed to bring me to the same beginning point, each time I wanted to make some personal improvements. The experiment in this note is to just track if each day, I've completed a certain task which is listed here.

Again, this list is not task exclusive, only there's proper goals for all of these. There're other goals/tasks in my routine which are not listed here.

## Everyday Tasks

### Undertaken on 2020-05-11

The average time for all the activities undertaken is not more than 1.5 hrs.

1. **Writing multiple "short notes" on a certain new things in "tech" that I learned**. [Goal]: What is important for this task is that I learn and *then write atleast something* about a set of new things *on the very same day* that I decided to learn them. This ritual has a high bar for breaking, since learning and writing should be doable from even a mobile phone. If there are no new things to learn/write that day, there's plenty of topics I can pick from the backlog (Google Keep).

2. **A Minimum of 10-Minute practice for piano**: Currently, I am easily loosing progress with learning piano and note-reading. All experts on Piano always maintain the requirement of learning it every day. What I've learnt so far (levels are from 1-10, 10 being the highest):

    * Note reading for the reference notes (L4, avg best time over 20 note readings: 1.5 seconds)
    * Note reading for the non-reference notes (L2, avg best time over 20 note readings: 4.5 seconds)
    * Chords for Intestellar theme (L3, Parts 1-10 out of parts: 144)

    [Goals] For a 3-week period
    * Note reading for non-reference notes and black notes (L4, avg time, approximately 1.5 seconds)
    * Chords for Intestellar theme (L4, Parts 1-28 with similar pattern)

3. **Two 10-minute sessions for home exercises**: [Goal]: There are 2 beginner workouts that I've learned and need to practice everyday - Full Boday workout and Cardio workout.
4. **Simple addition to weekend goals on week-days/ Simple learning window**: 30-minute window for either deciding goals for the weekend or learning/doing a small part of a bigger goal. [Goal]: Dedicated 30-minute window is spent in which there is a small progress. Some longing tasks:
    * Android game development course
    * OSS group initiatives
    * OSS personal initiatives

5. **No phone or social media after 8 PM**: Self-explanatory and required for fixing the sleep schedule.
